## New Features

### Tournament Rewards Checking and Claiming
The script now automatically checks for tournament rewards and claims them. This feature is enabled by default with `"info_check": true` and doesn't require additional settings.


### Results Analysis
A new script `analyze_results.py` has been added to the `logs` folder, which allows you to analyze account information from the `result.txt` file. The script provides the following statistics:

- Total number of accounts, cards, fantasy points, fragments
- Average values of various metrics across accounts
- Statistics on accounts with rewards and packs
- List of accounts with tournament rewards and pending packs
- Top 5 accounts by various metrics

To run the analysis:
```bash
cd logs
python analyze_results.py
```

## Improvements in Account Information
Additional information is now recorded in the `result.txt` file:

- `tournament_rewards` - tournament rewards that have been received
- `pending_packs` - packs that have been received but not claimed
- `packs` - packs received from spinning the roulette
- `active_tournaments` - information about active tournaments and decks

Example entry in `result.txt`:
```
0x6Be3866Cb9eca40849189bA709Db5C111239496C:stars=0:gold="0":portfolio_value=1069.7:number_of_cards=17:fantasy_points=3840:fragments=5:onboarding_done=False:whitelist_tickets=2:gliding_score=6507.37:rewards=0:tournament_rewards=Tournament2:FAN(40),FRAGMENT(70),WHITELIST_TICKET(2):pending_packs=PACK(1)
```

## Tournament Registration
The tournament registration module allows automatic participation in various Fantasy Top tournaments. The functionality includes:

- Automatic retrieval of available cards on the account
- Smart selection of optimal combinations of 5 cards for each tournament type
- Consideration of star limitations: Bronze (18), Silver (23), Gold (25), Elite (no limit)
- Algorithm for selecting the most valuable cards considering rating and stars
- Multiple deck registrations for one tournament if the account has enough cards

### Important tournament features:

1. **Selecting only one tournament type**:
   - You can enable only one tournament type at a time (Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Elite)
   - If multiple tournaments are enabled in the configuration, the script will automatically choose only the first one
   - It's recommended to explicitly enable only one desired tournament, setting `"enabled": false` for others

2. **Registering multiple decks**:
   - The script automatically determines how many complete decks can be created from available cards
   - The maximum possible number of decks will be created for each tournament type, taking into account star restrictions
   - Each deck must consist of 5 unique cards
   - One card cannot be used in multiple decks

3. **Updating tournament IDs**:
   - Tournament IDs change for each new tournament
   - Be sure to update the IDs in the configuration before running
   - Tournament ID can be found in the tournament page URL or through the browser network debugger

## Debugging
In the `utils.py` file, you can change the value of `DEBUG_MODE = True` to get detailed logs. By default, debug mode is disabled to minimize output.

## Logs
All operations are logged in the terminal and in the `logs/app.log` file:
- SUCCESS: successful operations (green color)
- ERROR: errors (red color)

Successful accounts are saved in `logs/success_accounts.txt`.
Failed attempts are recorded in `logs/failure_accounts.txt` for subsequent retries.
